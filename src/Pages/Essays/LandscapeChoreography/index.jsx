      <p>Landscape Choreography is about movement through space as dance rather than unthinking, rote, functional routine. Landscape Choreography challenges the everyday getting from here to there. It is about breaking unspoken, deeply ingrained rules and transgressing unseen yet firmly established boundaries. The goal is to upend and unsettle, to see and experience place with new eyes and a fresh mind. It is a radical practice for reimagining the places we inhabit, our connection to them, and our connection to each other and the social conventions and systems of power that bind us. </p>
      <p>In 1991 I hiked the Appalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine, an experience that changed me because, sleeping on the ground for nights on end, drinking when thirsty, walking and resting, and knowing previously unknown rhythms of sun and weather, I felt a deep, daily connection to earth for the first time since childhood. This experience would lead me to environmental and experiential education, then to university teaching as a professional architect, to creative scholarship in landscape architecture focused on the idea and implications of walking, to writing about spiritual relationships to land and place, and finally to Landscape Choreography. Walking warrants scholarly study within environmental design fields because it counters the alienation caused by automobiles, inhuman cities, and virtual unreality. Walking also leads naturally to architectural and environmental phenomenology, and the aesthetic theory of atmospheres. My walking scholarship thus joins a field where some consciousness has already been raised about aesthetics and the processes of perception. (see links below)</p>
      <div className={classes.sectionDivider}/>
      <p>In 2015 I met landscape architect Elisa Serra and activist and choreographer  Emanuele Braga because we were all invited participants at a conference called “Let’s Walk Urban Landscapes,” held at Herrenhausen Gardens, sponsored by Hanover University, Germany. Elisa and Emanuele were brought in to conduct one of several breakout workshops that would use the city of Hanover as a living laboratory. I had already written about artistic tactics parallel to Serra and Braga’s Landscape Choreography (Jacks 2006). The evening before heading out to the city we met for an introduction and a practical orientation to what we would be doing. We practiced moving like dancers—bodies cooperating in space—and we established the faintest beginning of a mindset for moving freely out in public.</p>
      <p>In the morning I took the tram to the end of the line where members of our group would meet and begin the choreography. For practical reasons we divided into participants and followers. There were about 20 of us altogether, too many to all follow a single dancer/choreographer at once. The method of the choreography was a simple one. As in “Simon Says,” the participants had only to directly imitate whatever Emanuele did, as lead dancer and choreographer. And so it was we pleasurably moved through the city as children once again, laughing on the inside as we walked funny, looked up, crossed the street, walked in circles, and touched things that ordinary adults would not dare touch for fear of standing out as odd. We crossed private property boundaries, sometimes alarming security guards. We entered a grocery store and used the space in unexpected ways, much to the consternation of the manager, who chased us out. Had we done something illegal by behaving in unusual ways, or were we free to be weird while shopping? After we were forcefully ejected (we were on our way out) and Emanuele fell to his knees, and lowered his forehead to the pavement and placed his palms out flat, I felt a wave of personal fear and rising anxiety, because I suddenly felt that in fact we looked like terrorists. It looked like we were praying to our vicious god before blowing ourselves up. I felt suddenly that we had crossed a line that should not be crossed. But no one else read our antics in this way, and so my fears were revealed to me as exactly that: my fears—that shaped and constrained the way I moved and performed in the public realm. Later, imitating domesticated animals grazing, crossing tramway tracks on hands and knees, different kinds of fear arose: of looking stupid and being killed (or of being killed while looking stupid!) Falling, I had felt the failure of “normal” psychology, when it became clear I was never at risk of being killed, and it was only my ego that insisted it’s better to never look stupid. The experience was liberating.</p>
      <p>I invited Elisa and Emanuele to Miami University and the Institute for Food farm because I felt Landscape Choreography was a radical and powerful way to inaugurate the idea of experiential education and initiate collaborative design. In their interdisciplinary collaboration Serra and Braga identify phases: <i>to dig up, to seed, to crop, to maintain, to continue</i>. These are both agricultural phases and phases in building community. Several of the communities with which Serra and Braga have worked in the past are formed by people who lead fraught lives—they are people living on brownfields, people displaced, and people victimized through power-over economics. Digging up is a beginning toward healing. Seeds are sown. Intrinsic rewards are identified and gathered. This is community building toward self-sufficiency.</p>
      <p className={classes.pullQuote}>In their interdisciplinary collaboration Serra and Braga identify phases: <i>to dig up, to seed, to crop, to maintain, to continue</i>. These are both agricultural phases and phases in building community.</p>
      <p>Although the conditions of life may be different for those living on a brownfield, or otherwise displaced, many of us nevertheless feel powerless much of the time, and this is an obvious source of anxiety and frustration among students and teachers alike. Many of us feel profoundly displaced, denied our birthright as beings of the earth, because we are routinely called on to contribute to the unreal project of limitless growth. We are told there is not time for foolish things, for cherishing the miraculous. I do not mean we are told to not participate in the sustainability agenda—there is indeed money to be made there—rather, we are told there is not time for knowing, for caring for, and loving the earth. We get the dominant cultural message to remain stressed out and busy, to look away, and to run away. But contact with earth has a way of changing perspectives.</p>
      <p>The land supporting the Institute for Food farm has a rich history of human inhabitation. The Austin-Magie farmhouse, dating from 1841, is a testament to significant aspects of our agricultural history. Prior to this settlement the land was home to native peoples. The farm is a special place, not least of all because it possesses excellent topsoil, four feet deep, perfect for growing high-quality food without industrial chemicals. When the Institute for Food farmers began working the land you could say that it was a brownfield of sorts, albeit a subtle-looking one, because it had been mono-cropped in corn and soybeans for many years with chemical inputs and was therefore effectively dead. When Serra and Braga joined us in March, 2016, the first year of planting on the Institute for Food farm, we were aware of this legacy and we were aware of the soil tests.</p>
      <p>We were also aware of the desire on the part of some members of the Miami University community to bulldoze the remaining buildings on the Austin-Magie farm site, and to cap acres of this exceptionally fertile land with building slabs and asphalt surface parking lots for an expansion of athletic facilities, thus denying the reality and potential of the soil, effectively forever. This is like what Serra and Braga worked with at the degraded sites in Taranto (Italy), Cluj-Napoca (Romania), and Cottbus (Germany), only we are on the other side of the nightmare. Whereas their European sites needed reclamation, ours at Miami only needed protection from destruction through “progress.” It is ironic indeed that it could ever be considered a rational idea for Miami University to expand across Four Mile Creek, to destroy priceless Ohio historic property, and to seal off some of the most fertile soils in the region, but this is the very potential we continue to consider.</p>
      <div className={classes.sectionDivider}/>
      <p>By walking with Elisa Serra and Emanuele Braga we gained new perspectives. In his short paper and lecture, “Landscape Choreography: Public Gestures of Space Appropriation,” Emanuele Braga articulated the political and performative dimensions of Landscape Choreography. This theory established its relevance in relation to the several projects they have undertaken in Europe and at Miami. Serra and Braga, by giving us in microcosm a clear understanding of what it means to dig up, to seed, to crop, to maintain, and to continue, gave us nothing less than a vital initiation ritual without which it would have been impossible to go on.</p>
      <p>In Serra and Braga’s work, process is paramount, a point that is difficult to appreciate in an hour-long or day-long walk. The processes Serra & Braga are interested in and committed to involve much longer time horizons during which it becomes possible to operate as activists, facilitate social change, forge new social relationships, and build community and places in service to people. Which is to say that one might first “dance” with strangers, acquaintances, neighbors, or friends then walk out in the world as in “choreography,” and later begin to enact new social rituals and provoke art projects in service to community. </p>
      <p>Under the rubric of Landscape Choreography there are multiple dimensions of experience and it is up to the participant to decide what to do with that experience. To what degree might one interpret the experience as political, or “of the body,” or as an act of merging with atmosphere? It is up to the viewer to choose how he hears, touches, tastes, feels, smells, constructs, and imagines what happens in the duration of the field.</p>
      <p>What follows is a present tense journal description of the Landscape Choreography walk taken in March 2016 with a group of students in the Food Studies workshop on the Austin-Magie Farm. The photographs are by Elisa Serra.</p>
      <h3>The Walk</h3>
      <p>Emanuele gives instructions. What we will be doing will of course be our “choice to do or not do.” If we choose to do, we will follow the leader and do everything he does, “as a mirror.”</p>
      <p>“You are free,” he says, “. . . and no talking, be silent,” he commands.</p>
      <p>Finally, the words, “as you desire,” and “whatever you do, do it with pleasure.” Then, “spread out.”</p>
      <p>I know from the other times I have participated following Emanuele’s choreography that when people spread out they tend to organize themselves quite rigidly. When asked to “walk around” it usually takes just a few moments before everyone is walking in a perfect counter-clockwise circle. Such is the power of people’s propensity for finding a social order in which one can feel as if one is properly conforming.</p>
      <p>Emanuele turns and walks. . . and we follow . . .</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>

      </div>
      <p>Landscape Choreography unfolds like a play, with episodes separated by brief transitions during which it is possible to enjoy and reflect. We are playing like children. How many of us in the midst of harried lives get to play like children—where, exactly, and why, did all that joy go? Why would anyone give that up? But most of us do.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC4} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>Walking, we have passed through a hedgerow and now we are standing at the edge of the cornfield where the last row of stalks still stands, apparently just untouched by the combine that harvested the rest of the field last fall. Following the leader, we are each holding a stalk in the right hand. Now we are bending over, grasping the stalk with two hands. Now we are pulling, pulling, pulling until the stalk gives way, bringing with it a large intact clump of damp earth.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC5} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>Slowly, slowly we turn the stalks—all the weight is in the mass of earth, a strange center of gravity—and we smell, carefully and thoughtfully.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC6} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>Like smelling a flower.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC7} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>I perch the heavy clod of earth on my hooded head and balance, carefully. Don’t drop it. Holding it steady with the right hand, taking the right hand away, bringing the left hand in, and so on, in the act of steadying the earth and the cornstalk.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC8} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>After some moments we are walking, balancing cornstalks on our heads. We have become moving cornstalks.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC9} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>It feels good to be out in the rain, out in the open field, being cornstalk.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC10} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>And then we’re done, cornstalks become like lances pointing out of our bellies, then parrying slowly left, then slowly right, and finally becoming projectiles hurled in unison, one . . . two . . . three . . . four.</p>
      <p>We are lining up—two lines across from one another in the field. Emanuele is counting, “one, one . . . two, two . . . ,” and so on, pairing us up across the field, and then he is messing up the count, “eleven . . . thirteen,” for a moment of humor and fierce attention to the rule and control of people numbered.</p>
      <p>Now we are walking toward each other as strangers holding each other in each other’s gaze, each carrying a gift—a stick or stone or cornhusk—for the other, which raises the question: How often do we offer gifts to strangers? How easily do we make ourselves vulnerable and available in this way? How uncomfortable do I feel, how uncomfortable does the other feel, violating this most basic set of unspoken rules governing human interaction? Now we are to greet one another, to touch one another in some way, which of course is an invitation and a choice, unless one has not accepted, or is not able to accept, responsibility for one’s own choices. Of course, there is also the danger that the other will touch in a way that one does not wish for them to do, and then what will I do? This is the heart of individual human interaction and it is freighted with problems of violence, sexuality, and power. Will we—I and the other—be able to navigate it with sensitivity and with grace?</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC11} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>We will, and we do—a melting hug, </p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC12} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>hands clasped in a dream of meditation,</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC13} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>and what looks like a sculptural positioning, a pose about something, perhaps a game. </p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC14} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      Now we are lying in the field. It feels good to be looking up, rain falling on my face.
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC15} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>Now we are halfway across the field performing something I do not understand. </p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC16} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>We are alternately touching our heads and extending our arms.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC17} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>Is it something violent? Is my gut being pierced by a projectile, am I removing the projectile from my gut, or am I pulling out my intestine? Is this the battlefield Emanuele spoke of? Or am I some beautiful bird, strutting and preening?</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC18} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>We are covering our eyes.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC19} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>We are animals, folding our ears left then right, signaling as if a semaphore, or twitching meaninglessly.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC20} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>We are lined up, facing the woods at the edge of the field, holding honeysuckle twigs, now we are entering, carefully moving into the thicket, guarding eyes and holding branches for each other.</p>
      <p>In a few steps we are turning around to face the field, sitting down, looking out at the field through the scrim of branches. We are in a protected, cave-like place, with branches arcing overhead, drops of rainwater dripping. </p>
      <p>Quiet. Dripping sounds. A truck out on the road downshifts loudly, then stops, accelerates more quietly and the sound slowly diminishes altogether and it is quiet again. The person just to my right breathes deeply, so I inhale deeply and exhale, and the person to my left does the same, meaning Emanuele has breathed deeply and—whisper down the lane—we all breathe deeply—one by one.</p>
      <p>It is nice to be resting together under this canopy at the edge of the woods letting the rain fall all around. I sense sounds and temperature, “thermal delight,” and sight (both near-at-hand and far away vision), the folding and positioning of my body, the internal pressure of air drawn into my lungs, expanding my ribcage—I hear and faintly feel the beating of my heart. In this moment I become aware of my noticing—this is merging—this is the recognition of atmosphere in the spherical experience of the perceiving body in the nest of the world (Bachelard). I am just now reminded of the deep connection—despite the political import—between Serra and Braga’s Landscape Choreography and experiential education—the work that got me into education in the first place. I am reminded of all those times while hiking the Appalachian Trail, or in the woods by myself, when I would become aware of my noticing. These are moments affording peace and quiet self-reflection. With the rain falling, I am reminded of all those times on the trail in which I would pause and feel so in the present moment, so unencumbered.</p>
      <p>Now comes a humming turning into an <i>ohmmmm</i>, now filling with nasal overtones, now turning into a clucking and chattering, then monkey sounds, then human laughter—first forced, then heartfelt—and authentic belly laughs and their satisfied aftermath.</p>
      <p>We’re standing, turning, climbing slightly up and out of the space beneath the canopy and now we’re on the road that comes down through the woods from the top of the hill above the farm.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC21} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>We are picking up large logs and limbs together, hoisting them above shoulders and carrying them along the road—acting out, doing, both work and sacrifice.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC22} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>We are a procession, a long line of people going to a place that is defined by the road upon which we find ourselves, and by our very road-like nature.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC23} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>At the curve in the road we are carefully placing our burden of limbs and logs in a pile or pyre.</p>
      <p>We are continuing beyond the pile, over barbed wire next to an enormous tree at the edge of the paved county road where runoff water roars in a roadside ditch.</p>
      <p>Now we are lined up above the rushing water, shuffling sideways.</p>
      <p>Now we are kneeling close to the edge of the water scooping a handful of water and tossing it onto the opposite bank. It has been raining steadily for the past hour. There is water everywhere so why this action of dipping and tossing? What are we watering exactly?</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC24} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>Now we are changing the direction of our splashing, now we are splashing each other and laughing.</p>
      <div className={classes.figure}>
        <img src={LC25} className={classes.image} alt=""/>
      </div>
      <p>We are lined up on the white line at the edge of the road. We are kneeling, fingertips on the white line. We are standing. We are waving as a car passes. We are stepping into the roadway, stopping traffic so we may cross. This feels like a violation of the unspoken rule: let the cars always have right of way, but of course it is not, it is a rare act of kindness to people on foot.</p>
      <p>On the other side of the road we are taking up a handful of earth, which forms easily into a ball—it has a wonderful plasticity, a beautiful red-yellow color. We say, “I want this earth. I take this earth. It belongs to me.” It feels like stealing-not-stealing, taking-not-taking. Then, throwing the ball of earth back into the field, say, “I give it back. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
      <p>Then, walking, the choreography is over.</p>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>Landscape Choreography is design process and community building work that makes the familiar strange in productive ways. It shifts perspective. It is radical in the sense that it allows one to get at the root of something.</p>
      <p>Our students wrote reflections on the experience. Here, by way of conclusion, is a sample:</p>
      <p>Reflection on Landscape Choreography	[a student]</p>
      <p>Working with [Elisa Serra & Emanuele Braga] on the Austin-Magie Farm was easily one of the strangest, most uncomfortable experiences of my life. With each movement, I was left wondering “What will come next?” and “Has this been planned?” That all being said, I had never felt a weirder sense of connection with a class. Not only did I get to see people’s attitudes and reactions to being asked to participate in something so outside all of our comfort zones, but I got to do it with them; experiencing the held-back laughter, the feeling of the rain hitting the bare, warm skin of our faces, and playing follow the leader as grown-ups. At some moments, I never felt so alive, aware and completely open to the world. Other times, I couldn’t prevent the wincing and tension from taking over my body. But that is exactly what was so glorious about this experience. The choreography was weird, there is no other way to put it. I had to test my self-restraint with holding back laughter to not take away from the experience of my peers and maintain respect with my leader. At times it was so difficult I was fighting tears, which just filled me up with the greatest joy. There is nothing like a genuine, boisterous belly laugh, and fighting its release brought me back to every snicker and giggle of my childhood in school. Man, did it feel good to be silly again. Despite the joy this brought me, I didn’t exactly understand its purpose until attending Emanuele and Elisa’s lecture and reading about their work online. Under the context of community-building and activism, it started to make sense. It started to feel intentional. Emanuele made the irrational seem rational as soon as he shared his thought process. We really did build a community in chasing an eccentric man around our farm with our hands perked up by our faces like little animal ears. We really did demonstrate man’s outlook on land as his possession with our trampling, our destruction, our few, but choice words and our movement. We really did form a new connection with that land, especially given the less than perfect conditions that quickly became just perfect to our “dance.” I loved getting dirty and feeling like a kid again. I loved freeing myself of the social expectation to be normal. Even though I hope to never have to spend an hour and a half in a downpour, rubbing myself with mud and eating sticks again, that doesn’t mean I didn’t take anything away from my session with Elisa & Emanuele. I am so glad it happened and I truly don’t think that anything can stand in the way of this class after seeing how my colleagues and peers responded to true unpredictability.</p>
